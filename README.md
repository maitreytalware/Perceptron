# Perceptron
 
## Problem Statement

Consider the feedforward neural network with the following training set:

Thus s(1) are s(2) and in one class, s(3) and s(4) are in another class, s(5) is in a third
class, and s(6) is in a fourth class.

**Use the perceptron learning rule to try to find a set of weights and bias to correctly classify the training set. Here we assume zero initial weights and bias, a learn rate α = 0.7, and a small but positive value of θ.**
